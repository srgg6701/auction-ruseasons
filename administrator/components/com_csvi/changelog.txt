Version 0.1
Import
+ Numbers imported with a comma are changed to a period for correct database
  insertion. This I found necessary since my locale uses comma as a seperator.
  The only thing I do not know/understand is, how to get a comma on the webshop
  frontend?
+ Imported data is sanitized for database insertion. This means that you can
  use regular HTML code in your long description or apostrophe in your products
  name for example.
